Use the MNIST data set to do a multiclassification on digit as well as colors


The MNIST data set has numbers form 0-9 and to each image we add a color as well as a blurry background
Thus each image has 2 attributes - color (R,G,B) and digit(0-9)

We then build and train a CNN to do a multiclassification on digits and colors
